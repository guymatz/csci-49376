# Project 3

## To run:
1. Install pyspark
1. run pyspark in the usual way, e.g. `python p3.py`

## Description

* Cancer diagnosis using machine learning
* Data set:
    * Labels: B (benign), M (Malignant)
    * Features: 20 clinical variables
    * 569 samples
    * On the blackboard
* Select two machine learning algorithms (e.g. Random
Forest) to train and evaluate prediction models and
compare their performances
* Using Spark MLLib
    * https://spark.apache.org/mllib/

## Due Date, etc.

* Due: 11:59pm, 5/21
* Project review: 9am-11am, 5/22
* Codes
* Readme
* Report
    * Justification of the algorithms that you choose
    * Your training procedure
* Data splits, cross-validation etc.
    * Your testing results
* Report using F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
* Comparison of two algorithms.
    * Discussion
* Limitations and future improvement.


# STEPS
. Put the data in usable format
